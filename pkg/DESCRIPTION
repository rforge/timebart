Author: Rodney Sparapani <rsparapa@mcw.edu>
Maintainer: Rodney Sparapani <rsparapa@mcw.edu>
Description: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) have been shown
	to provide flexible nonparametric modeling of covariates to
	binary and continuous outcomes.  This R package extends BART
	to time-to-event outcomes with right censoring including
	recurrent events.
